 <div class="text1"><strong>a family on their lawn one sunday in westchester, n.y. 1968 </strong><br><br>

a woman and a man sunbathe while a boy bends over a small plastic wading pool behind them. In 1972, Neil Selkirk was put in charge of producing an exhibition print of this image when Marvin Israel advised him to make the background trees appear “like a theatrical backdrop that might at any moment roll forward across the lawn.”. This anecdote illustrates vividly just how fundamental dialectics between appearance and substance are for the understanding of Arbus’s art. A print was sold at auction in 2008 for $553,000.</div>
