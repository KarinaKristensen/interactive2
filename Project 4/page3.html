 <div class="text3"><strong>identical twins</strong><br><br>

depicts two young twin sisters standing side by side in matching corduroy dresses, white tights, and white headbands in their dark hair. Both stare into the camera, one slightly smiles and the other slightly frowns. The photo has been said to sum up Arbus’ vision. Arbus’ inquiry into identity reaches a climax in this photograph with the noticeable tension between the girls’ being twins and individuals at the same time. Their extreme closeness, the uniformity of their clothing and haircut underline their close bond while the facial expressions strongly emphasise their individuality.
