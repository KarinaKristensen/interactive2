Diane Arbus is an American photographer best known for her black-and-white portraits. Arbus often photographed people on the fringes of society, including the mentally ill, transgender people, and circus performers. “A photograph is a secret about a secret. The more it tells you the less you know,” she once mused. She was born in 1923 in New York. Having struggled with depressive episodes throughout her life, Arbus committed suicide in 1971 at the age of 48. Today, her works are held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. among others.
