Diane Arbus is an American photographer best known for her black-and-white portraits. Arbus often photographed people on the fringes of society, including the mentally ill, transgender people, and circus performers. Interested in probing questions of identity, Arbus’s Identical Twins, Roselle, New Jersey (1967), simultaneously captured the underlying differences and physical resemblance of twin sisters. “A photograph is a secret about a secret. The more it tells you the less you know,” she once mused. Born Diane Nemerov on March 24, 1923 in New York, NY, she was raised in a wealthy family, enabling her to pursue artistic interests from an early age. Having struggled with depressive episodes throughout her life, Arbus committed suicide on July 26, 1971 at the age of 48. Today, her works are held in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others.
